## ðŸŽ¯ Product Vision Statement
University of Phayao has implemented a Passenger Density Detection System on its campus shuttle buses. This intelligent system utilizes sensors and data analysis to monitor and report the number of passengers on board in real-time.

By accurately measuring passenger density, the system helps in managing bus occupancy levels, reducing overcrowding, and optimizing bus schedules. The data collected can also support future planning and development of the universityâ€™s transportation services.

This initiative reflects the University of Phayaoâ€™s commitment to smart campus solutions, sustainability, and the well-being of its academic community.
